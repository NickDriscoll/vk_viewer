Todo:
    Generate terrain with compute shader
    Physically-based bloom
    Ray-marched volumetric sunlight
    Scene graph
    Simple environment probe for indirect diffuse/specular light
    Deferred/Batched GPU uploading
        Sort of have deferred uploading for PNGs
    Texture compression
        Figure out why images smaller than the BC7 block size don't compress correctly
        For now I have clamped the mip levels
    Fix Imgui flickering bugs
    Move glTF optimization off of main thread
    Rewrite the HLSL multiview shader in the new version of Slang
    Add UserConfiguration struct
        Window size
    Add render pass abstraction
    
Shader issues:
    Redundancy wrt model_fragment and terrain_fragment
    Non-physical lighting calculations aka actually try to understand PBR

Required pipelines:
    Opaque lit
    Opaque shadowed
    Alpha-tested lit
    Alpha-tested shadowed
    Post-Processing
