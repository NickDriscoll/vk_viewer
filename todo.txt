Todo:
    Generate terrain with compute shader
    Physically-based bloom
    Ray-marched volumetric sunlight
    Scene graph
    Deferred/Batched GPU uploading
        Sort of have deferred uploading for PNGs
    Texture compression
        Figure out why images smaller than the BC7 block size don't compress correctly
            For now I have clamped the mip levels
    Fix Imgui flickering bugs
    Move glTF->OzyMesh optimization off of main thread
    Add UserConfiguration struct
        Window size
    Add render pass abstraction
    Add ability to mix and match mesh materials
    Irradiance maps
        Simple environment probe for indirect diffuse/specular light
    Change shadow map data such as cascade distances to be data-driven
    
Shader issues:
    Redundancy wrt model_fragment and terrain_fragment

Required pipelines:
    Opaque lit
    Opaque shadowed
    Alpha-tested lit
    Alpha-tested shadowed
    Post-Processing
