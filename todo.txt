Todo:
    Make generic error macro
    Fix Imgui flickering bugs
    Change shadow map data such as cascade distances to be data-driven
    Add orbit cam tweaking controls
    Parallax mapping family of techniques
    Deferred/Batched GPU uploading
        Sort of have deferred uploading for PNGs
    Move glTF->OzyMesh optimization off of main thread
    Physically-based bloom
    Ray-marched volumetric sunlight
    Add UserConfiguration struct
        Window size
    Add ability to mix and match mesh materials
    Irradiance maps
        Simple environment probe for indirect diffuse/specular light
    Generate terrain with compute shader
        Convert to heightmap representation
    Add render pass abstraction
    
Known issues:
    Redundancy wrt model_fragment and terrain_fragment
    Texture compression
        Figure out why images smaller than the BC7 block size don't compress correctly
            For now I have clamped the mip levels

Required pipelines:
    Opaque lit
    Opaque shadowed
    Alpha-tested lit
    Alpha-tested shadowed
    Post-Processing
